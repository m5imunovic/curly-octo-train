This document contains basic install instructions for running the project.
We need to track prerequisites for the installation of binaries in pipeline (e.g. simulators, assemblers)
In addition the pip requirements file needs to be properly maintained.

# Installation

We recommend the usage of mamba for setting up Python environment:

```bash
## Install mamba
conda install mamba -n base -c conda-forge
conda update mamba -c conda-forge
mamba init

## Create new environment
mamba env create --file=environment.yaml
```
