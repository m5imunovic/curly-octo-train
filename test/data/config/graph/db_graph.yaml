name: db_graph
overwrite: False # set to True if you want to overwrite the existing data
graph_type: multigraph # either digraph or multigraph
experiment: experiment_1
#supported features for digraph (edge is just a k-mer):
# kc - coverage
# ln - length, i.e. number of nucleotides in node
# in_degree - input degree of nodes
# out_degree - out degree of nodes
# pr_N - k-step PageRank where N represent number of hops (supported up to N = 5)
# For now coverage (col0) and length (col1) are always added and used
features: [kc, ln, in_degree, out_degree, pr_2]
